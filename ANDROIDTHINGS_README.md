# Simple Peripheral UI (Java)

This utility exposes the GPIO of an Android Things device as switch widgets in
a graphical UI. You review the state of inputs, and click the switches to control
the state of outputs.

## Introduction

This utility shows on the attached display Android [Switch][switch-ref] widgets for each GPIO pin exported by the board.

When you click or tap on the switch, the GPIO active status switch from HIGH to LOW according to the widget state.

You can attach LEDs or other digital output peripheral to your GPIO pins and toggle them on and off without changing a single line of code
(if you connect LEDs: make sure you add 470 ohms current-limiting resistors in series to avoid damaging them).
